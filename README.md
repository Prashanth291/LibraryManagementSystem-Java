![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-21-blue.svg) ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3.3.5-brightgreen.svg) ![Maven](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Maven-orange.svg)

A full-featured web application for managing a library's books, members, and transactions. Originally a Java console application, this project was refactored into a modern web service using the Spring Boot framework, featuring role-based security, a persistent database, and a dynamic web interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Role-Based Security:** Differentiated user roles with distinct permissions:
    * **ADMIN:** Full access to all management features, including adding, editing, and deleting books and members.
    * **LIBRARIAN:** Can view data and manage core library operations like borrowing and returning books.
* **Book Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the library's book catalog.
* **Member Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing library member accounts.
* **Transaction Management:** Complete lifecycle for library transactions:
    * **Borrowing:** Assign a book to a member, updating book availability.
    * **Returning:** Process returned books and update records.
* **Persistent Database:** Utilizes a file-based H2 database to ensure all data (books, members, transactions) is saved permanently across application restarts.
* **Web-Based Database Console:** Includes an embedded H2 console for direct database viewing and management during development.
* **Dynamic Frontend:** A user-friendly web interface built with Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of all views.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot package structure to ensure a clean separation of concerns:
* `config`: Contains security and other application-level configurations.
* `controllers`: Handles incoming web requests and maps them to the appropriate views.
* `models`: Defines the core data structures (JPA Entities) like `Book`, `Member`, etc.
* `repositories`: Spring Data JPA interfaces for database operations.
* `services`: Contains the business logic of the application.
* `resources/templates`: Contains all the Thymeleaf HTML files for the frontend.
* `resources/static`: For static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
